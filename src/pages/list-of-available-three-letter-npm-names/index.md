title: List of available 3 letter npm names

Do you want a cool npm name as [ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava), [vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue) or [koa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa)?
But can't find one?

I got a list of all _available npm packages_ here. But first consider using a [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope),
like [@medv/list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@medv/list) or [@cycle](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs).
It's much cooler, and npm will be completely different, if scopes were mandatory.

Is this list up-to date? Well, almost (🙃) I created a npm [package](https://github.com/antonmedv/find-npm-name) for updating the list.

```
npm install -g fnn
```

And run it

```
fnn
```

After a certain about of time (about a few hours) you will get [available.txt](https://github.com/antonmedv/find-npm-name/blob/master/available.txt)
file with all available npm packages. Send a PR to update the list.
